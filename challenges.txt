Problems I encountered and fixes
    1. configuring app.yaml
        -   specifying the dependent 'libraries'
    2. linking static css file to the html template
        -   For this, I had to create a new folder called 'static'.
            In the html file, link css normally. But, we need to
            specify this path in app.yaml
